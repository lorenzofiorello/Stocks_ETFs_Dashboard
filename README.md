# Stocks & ETFs Indicators Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard with Stocks/ETF performance indicators 
This project provides a simple Power BI dashboard for a Kaggle dataset about stocks and etfs prices.  
This dataset contains daily observations of opening and closing prices for all tickers currently (1980-2020) trading on NASDAQ.  
My goal was to create a simple Power BI dashboard that can be useful to get some insights about financial data.   
In the page "Stocks" you will find three charts:  
- Total Stocks Volume Current Year: this chart shows the total Stocks volume aggregated by month, in the last available year in the dataset
- Weighted Average Price of Stocks: this chart reports the total weighted average price of stocks, aggregated by year
- Yesterday Stocks Data: this chart shows some informations regarding the latest available day in the dataset.
In the page "ETFs" you will find three charts:  
- Total ETF Volume Current Year: this chart shows the total ETF volume aggregated by month, in the last available year in the dataset
- ETF Volume and Closing Price by Year: this chart reports the total ETF volume and price aggregated by year
- Yesterday ETF Data: this chart shows some informations regarding the latest available day in the dataset.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Power BI file**:
   - [Download the .pbix file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ilVkD060Kr9gt42vuoBWL7jql9fN4uPi/view?usp=sharing).
   
2. **Open the file in Power BI Desktop**:
   - Make sure you have **Power BI Desktop** installed on your computer. You can download it for free from [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
   
3. **Interact with the Dashboard**:
   - Once the file is open in Power BI, you can filter the data by year, ETF, or stock, and dynamically view the charts.
  
## Next Steps
I would like next to continue analyzing the ETF data in particular since I have noticed some inaccuracies.
Next, I would like to update the dataset to include the data about the period 2021-present.
Finally, It would be interesting to automatise this dashboard, so that it can always show the most recent data.
